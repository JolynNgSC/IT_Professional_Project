# IT_Professional_Project
As the project coordinator (Team Leader) for my final year project, I orchestrated our team's efforts toward the successful completion of an IT project. This experience not only honed my leadership skills but also provided valuable insights into effective project management practices.

### Executive Summary 
The project's primary objective is to create an engaging Power BI data dashboard that showcases past real estate price patterns. In addition, the team will thoroughly analyse essential aspects of the Project Management Plan, including Integration, Scope, Time, Quality, Communications, Human Resources, Risk, and Procurement Management to ensure the project's success.

Under my guidance, the team outlined the scope and requirements and delivered the dashboard promptly and within the designated scope.
